“For those who believe in God, most of the big questions are answered. But for those of us who can't readily accept the God formula, the big answers don't remain stone-written. We adjust to new conditions and discoveries. We are pliable. Love need not be a command nor faith a dictum. I am my own god. We are here to unlearn the teachings of the church, state, and our educational system. We are here to drink beer. We are here to kill war. We are here to laugh at the odds and live our lives so well that Death will tremble to take us.”
― Charles Bukowski

'It means seeking out beauty with all our senses. It means pulling ourselves back from the constant pursuit of more, so we can notice what’s already in our field of vision. It means slowing down enough to look, and paying attention to what lies beneath the surface. It means surrounding ourselves with things and people and ideas we love and cherish. And it means reflecting, every now and then, about the fact that life is a cycle, not a forever, and that it’s short and precious'
— Wabi Sabi

Everyone is scared of love. It takes a strong person to be scared of happines. Let's say you meet the love of your life. It’s still going to end. Whether by the slow pull of a disease, whether it be the corosion of two personalities that reshape eachother until they are incompatible, or maybe the old stranger in the bar who says the things that need to be said to that person at that night. The point is, happiness always ends! Best case scenario is you die at the same time.

'This experience of wabi sabi is often felt in the presence of natural materials, which is why spending time in nature can be such a powerful experience.
