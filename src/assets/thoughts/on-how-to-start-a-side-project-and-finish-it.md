# On how to start a side-project (and finish it)

Most side-projects I start have never seen the light of day. However, recently I came up with a super simple process to actually build apps from start to finish. The magic of iterative development, who would have thought?

- open a document (any editor, I use [Craft.do](craft.do)) and write out the problem the app will solve, and the (max 5) must have features
- gather inspiration of existing apps and paste them in a Figma file (or, any other interfacing software)
- get your app live. My process here looks like: create a GitHub repo; Init a Vue project, add Supabase, LucideIcons and TailwindCSS; host on Netlify
