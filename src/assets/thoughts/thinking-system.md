Get a simple notebook, write anything worth wrting down in it. Review your notes each week.

Discard the ones that don't resonate with you anymore.

Review the other; meaning you write them out in your own words, or even link them to other thought's you've had. I use Obsidian for this, since it gives me nice .md files and has a great linking mechanism. But anything works.

As of now, I love this hybrid between physical and digital. Forcing myself to write down my thoughts in a physical form keeps me from creating huge notes that don't mean anything to me a day later. This way, I only spend more than 1 minute on a thought if, days later, it still resonates with me.

Try it out. It might change how you think.
